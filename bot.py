# FAQ Content
FAQ_TEXT = """❓ Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How fast is the sniper?
A: Our sniper is optimized for maximum speed, typically joining within 100-300ms of detecting an invite link.

Q: Why am I not joining some groups?
A: Several factors can affect success:
• Invite link already expired
• Group already full
• You're rate limited by Telegram
• Network latency issues

Q: Is this safe to use?
A: Yes, we use official Telegram APIs. However:
• Use at your own risk
• Don't share your session/access code
• Avoid running multiple instances

Q: What's the success rate?
A: Success rates vary based on:
• Your internet connection
• Server location
• Competition
• Group settings
